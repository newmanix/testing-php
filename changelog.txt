The repo contains PHP unit test examples using the  
software SimpleTest (http://www.simpletest.org/).

Installation:

Upload all into a sub-folder on your PHP server space.

Install SimpleTest in the folder named simpletest.

Try out the test files in the root folder in approximately this order:

calculator_test1.php - Runs code against a Calculator class.  Adds 2 numbers. 
Does not incorporate SimpleTest.
 
calculator_test2.php - Demonstrates failed tests against Calculator class. 
Includes 2 purposeful failing tests, 3 parameters when 2 expected, divide by zero.

calculator_test3.php - Demonstrates successful tests against Calculator class.

contact_test1.php - Demonstrates successful tests against a PHP contact form.

contact_test2.php - Demonstrates a failed test against a PHP contact form.  
User did not enter their name.

password_form_test.php - Demonstrates passing tests against a mock login form.

There are also files that run more than one test:

suite.php - Includes several of the test files and runs them at one time

run_all.php - Uses a PHP script to run all files that include the string 'test' 
in the file name in the current folder

View how the files work via a browser then view them internally to see 
how they are put together.
